    <h2> The Band.</h2>
    
    <p>
    Lucy Spacehead was a 5 piece punk rock outfit from Philadelphia, PA.
    The band consisted of Ryan Breen (frontman, guitars, vocals), Calvin
    Morrison (bass), Matt King (drums), Robbie Baranov (guitar, backing
    vocals) and Ho Jun (guitar).

    <p>
    The incarnation of Lucy Spacehead was strictly a live band for Ryan
    Breen, but that didn't make it any less awesome
    </p>
