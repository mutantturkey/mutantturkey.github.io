<h2>My Mobile Battle Station</h2>
<p width=>
I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X220, equipped with 4gb of ram, a Intel i5 processor,
and extended battery. With the extended battery, and using linux I can get
upwords of 9 hours of usage, even more if i'm avoiding the internet.

<h2>Headphones</h2>
<p>
I have a trusty pair of Sennheiser HD-280's that have lasted me for years. For
$99.00 I would not recommend any other pair of headphones.

If you look at the 3.5mm jack I have modified mine using a <a
href="www.neutrik.us">Neutrik</a> jack with a 90' angle. After my original jack
wore out, I needed an upgrade and found that an angled option works best for
usage with laptops, phones, and other devices.
