    <p>
Copyright Infringement is a two peice, low budget, low quality, punk rock group. It is comprised of John Calvin Morrison, and David Kenneth Morris. In the summer of 2010, they pulled together to create something totally crude, halarious and downright offensive. Currently they are in the process of writing material for a fulll length album. All of their music is released under Creative Commons, as well as any of their videos and bonus material.
