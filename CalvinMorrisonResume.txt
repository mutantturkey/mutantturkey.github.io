Scientific Programmer - Bioinformatics research tools @ Drexel. ( January 2013 - Fall 2014 )
- PyFeast, a feature selection toolkit wrapper in Python.
- Fizzy, metogenomic feature selection based using Python and PyFeast, and intregrated into QIIME,
- Pogo-DB, a fully fledged interactive web database written in PHP for querying gene similarity between species. 
  MySQL used as backend, PHP frontend.
- dna-utils, high-performance DNA parsing and primer strand counting written in C.
- SelectiveWholeGenomeAmplification, automated primer design based on brute force sweeps and paramter filtration of specific DNA primers for use in real world samples. The bulk of the tools are scripted together with Bash, and written in Python and C.
- Quikr, a taxonomic classifier using compressive sensing in C and OpenMP
- Web Queuing system for in-house classification software, written with the web2py Python web framework, for use with quikr.

  nginx for other applications

Computer Vision Programmer - Automated Fly Video Tracking and Analysis @ Drexel C.S. (May - Dec 2012)
- Developed high throughput tools in C, using ImageMagick, OpenCV and OpenMP for tracking fruit fly
  learning and memory tracking.
- Benchmarked tools and formalized software review, and improved performance to make product viable
  for scientists to use.
- Experience with color normalization, blob detection, and motion tracking using OpenCV
- Shell scripting for automated processing and modified tools for parallelization across a cluster.
- Currently in use at The Maranda Lab at Drexel.
