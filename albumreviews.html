    <h2> Album Reviews</h2>
    
    <p>

Here are albums I suggest for listening. <br>
</p>

<p>
Artist - Album - URL:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Alestorm, Captain Morgans Revenge</strong> - board the plank ye'
scurrrvy scallywags, because Alestorm is an awesome pirate metal band, plenty
of sea shantys combined with a good metal mood, and ridiculous lyrics. Alestorm
is an experience you will never forget. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Amity In Fame, Dinner For One</strong> - quite a nice combination of acoustic guitar mixed with a class hard rock feel. strong carrying vocals and interesting guitar riffs, overall this album is definitely an oringinal one.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Apparatjik, We Are Here</strong> - it's hard to explain what this album
is, nothing short of genius. Guy Barryman ( Coldplay ) teamed up with Jonas of
Mew brings you an techno driven pop album that will draw you in for many
listens. We Are Here is creepy with an odd combination of sounds.  tracks like
Datascroller will make you tap your foot while Arrow And Bow will give you
goosebumps.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Band Of Horses - Infinite Arms</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong> Carbon Leaf, Echo Echo</strong> - Last year one of my good friends
introduced me to Carbon Leaf, and ever since they have been one of my relax
bands. Echo Echo is an excellent album, it is extremely mellow and catchy.
favorite tracks? I couldn't tell you. they all rock.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Circa Survive, Blue Sky Noise</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Coheed and Cambria, The Second Stage Turbine Blade</strong> - this is
hands down the greatest concept album ever created in the history of mankind,
far surpassing anything The Beatles or Pink Floyd did. words to descibe the
feeling i get while listening to this are almost impossible to find. gut
wrenching lyrics, detailed background guitar, ridiculous bass lines and an
insane drummer, all coupled into an album. the concept, is hard to fathom. a
giant science fiction fantasy about Claudio Kilgannon, taking place in an
alternative universe, that spans across 5 albums, there is no story better
drawn than The Amory Wars - the underlying story behind Coheed and Cambria's
music. The Second Stage Turbine Blade started it all for me, take the time to
listen to it, i wouldn't be surprised if you didn't like it, but stick with it
and you'll find yourself blow away.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Dada Weatherman</strong> - Mind Of Blue
</p>

<p>
<strong>Davenport Cabinet, Nostalgia In Stereo</strong> - Travis Stever, Lead Guitarist for the previously noted Coheed and Cambria takes a vastly different approach than his typical ridiculous shredding and screeching solos. In fact, this album is quite relaxing. It's a folk album but has a definite undertone of classic rock roots. Travis has a strange voice that ends up fitting in perfectly. I listen to this album quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
Death Cab For Cutie - Plans
</p>

<p>
Diablo Swing Orchestra - The Butchers Ballroom
</p>

<p>
<strong>Flat People, Self Titled </strong> - yet another self titled album that
is awesome. Flat People is a groovy chill album incorperating alot of cool
sounds. It sort of reminds me of Pink Floyd yet has distinctly non floydish
tendencies. Check it out, and give it a listen. Awesome builds and smooth
vocals pull it together nicely.
</p>

<p>
<strong> Flobots, Fight With Tools</strong> - definitely one of the most
influential albums i've listened to. being of sound mind and moral stature, i
cannot help but question our global condition after listening to Fight With
Tools. this album will certainly make you second guess America's bureaucracy.
it is a call to arms to every listener to stand up and fight. give it a listen,
you might find yourself on a path that will open your mind.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good Old War, Only Way To Be Alone -</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Green Day, American Idiot</strong> - in fifth grade, i purchased my
first CD, American Idiot. since then i have listened to it numerous times and
have the entire album memorized. Green Day is a classic punk band of the 90's,
yet this album has a very different feel than Dookie or Warning. an excellent
concept album, it encapsulates a variety of styles and instruments. i consider
this by far one of the most influential albums of the 2000s, and the best album
Green Day has released. give it a go, and you will soon be singing along.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Hot Hot Heat - Elevator</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Houdini Roadshow - Down in the City</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Jonathan Coulton, Smoking Monkey</strong> - while he isn't much of the album type, Jonathan Coulton continually comes again and again with single songs that make the top nerd charts. he has an excellent writing style and a relaxed voice. funny and interesting lyrics make sure that you will be singing them in your head. I would suggest you not check this album, but more of his singles
</p>

<p>
<strong>John Mayer Trio - Try!</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Liquid Kitchen - 2 Days A Night</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>major Major - Major Major</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mew, Frengers</strong> -  Frengers is really an interesting peice of
art. Jonas has a smooth voice that blends in with the vocals, the music is
extremely relaxed yet the drums are upbeat and sometimes even a bit harsh. the
music just flows in and out in this album. Frengers is a portmanteu of friends
and strangers, and that is what the album feels like, they are strangers but
you get to know them throughout the album. awesome builds and intense lyrics,
mew is one of the great indie bands out there.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mew - And The Glass Handed Kites</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>NanowaR - Other Bands Play, Nanowar Gay!</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Nightwish - Wishmaster</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Phantom Planet,  Raise The Dead</strong> - easily Phantom Planet's
finest record, this work of art was enthralling. like a good book, i simply
could not put it down. every song on this album is incredible. it carries an
extremely distinct sound, yet all the songs use different elements to create a
diverse album. don't miss out on it, because you will come back to Raise The
Dead again and again.
</p>

<p>
<strong>pornophonique - 8-bit lagerfeuer</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Proclaimers - Sunshine on Leith</strong> - What's more cheesy than
these scottish brothers singing songs to make girls swoon? I have no idea - but
this album is one of my favorites.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Shabutie - Plan to Take Over the World</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Silversun Pickups - Swoon</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sum 41 - All Killer No Filler</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Talco - Combat Circus</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical Cats - Typical Cats</strong> - The Typical Cats rap collective
is fantastic. Qwel, Qwazaar, Denizen Kane and DJ Natural tear it up in this
sick rap album. Fantastic samples, even better raps, whitty lyrics and awesome
scratching make this group some of the best underground rap out of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Wonder Years - Suburbia, You've Taken Everything And Now I'm
Nothing</strong> - If you like Philadelphia written, suburban bordom driven, pop
punk drivel of a frustrated guy in his mid 20's, this album is for you. 9/10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Zac Brown Band - Pass The Jar</strong> - A really great live album from
Zac Brown, a contemporary southern/country singer. He has a really strong band,
and this album features a wide array of guest singers which makes it really
diverse. A great example of country done right. A good mix of oldies
and originals.
