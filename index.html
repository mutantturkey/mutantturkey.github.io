    <h2> Me, Myself, and Goodbye.</h2>
    
    <p>
This shouldn't read like a obituary but I fear it will. <br> 
The complete disregard for any "web 2.0" formatting doesn't help either. <br>
I am Mutant Turkey, on-line at least. <br>
In person, I am Calvin Morrison. <br> 
I don't have a wikipedia page yet. <br>
I like to play chess. <br>

I am also a GNU/Linux user, who prefers the <a href="http://archlinux.org"> Arch Linux</a>  Distro to all others. <br> 
As far as I am concerned, everything is bloated, slow, crappy and overly complex. <br> 
I like the Unix Philosophy. <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/">Less is More.</a> <br>
I like the C programming language. It is clean, concise, and unforgiving. <br>
I dispise Java, C++, and C#. <br>
I am interested in Go. <br>
